## How to play
In order for the game to process the keys, use the English layout.

After launching the game, you will be asked to choose the character you will play with: X or 0 (to select, press Q or W, respectively).

In order to make a move, you must press one of the keys: Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C. The move will be made to the cell of the field, which is located in a similar place to the pressed key on the QWERTY layout.

The goal of the game is to occupy any horizontal, vertical, or diagonal with your symbols and prevent your opponent from doing the same.

After the game is over, you will be prompted to play again, press Y to agree or any other key to refuse.
